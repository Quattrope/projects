Miscellaneous Projects:

Map: Functional Google Maps mockup that uses rastering and routing to provide expected user functionality

Database: Implementing and stress-testing a relational database schema using Java

CSP Solver:
      You are given the task of ordering guests at a party by age given only their age relationships in the form of exclusionary constraints, i.e.
      (x y z) indicating the age of z is NOT between those of x and y. I employ a reduction
      to 3SAT, a canonical NP-complete problem, then use a SAT solver combined with
      simulated annealing as a heuristic to solve the problem up to inputs of size 400.
      I also explore the use of local search optimization to improve starting state performance.
